Parents of Prateek Tiwari
It was the day of counselling when I witnessed the beautiful campus of KIIT for the first time. That day Prateek got admission in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. As a parent, I am really happy that today, after 4 years, he has a job in hand.

I want to express my gratitude towards the School of Electronics for providing all the facilities that any electronics student would need. I would like to thank the professors of the School of Electronics Engineering for always being there for my son. Their guidance has helped him to forge his career.” – MANOJ KUMAR TIWARY and RASHMI TIWARY, Parents of Prateek Tiwari, ETC, 2021 graduated batch, Placed in Capgemini, Accenture, Cognizant, Wipro, TCS(Ninja), HighRadius.

K-Xplore (Practice Oriented Open Elective \u2013 I)  The B. Tech. curriculum provides for a 1-Credit practice-oriented Open Elective K-Xplore in Semester V to make our undergraduate engineering programme holistic, multidisciplinary, skill-based, and balanced.  This course allows the students to explore the opportunity that the KIIT University offers to them to sharpen their skills in areas which excite them the most.  Offered in a self-learning mode, this  subject allows the students to hone their skills in areas they are passionate about which they select from a wide spectrum of subjects in art, literature, technology, community engagement and service, health, and environment and sustainability. In addition, the students develop soft skills that are important for them in their professional life. This course, thus, allows students to explore and grow in areas outside of core academics and provides a channel for complementing the lessons learned in the classroom, offering them the opportunity to apply academic skills in a real-world context and providing a truly well-rounded education.  This course is designed on the basis of the guiding philosophy of student-centered learning where the students define problems, evaluate alternatives, design solutions, and self-learn by performing certain assigned activities with limited guidance from faculty facilitators.   Each student selects an area of his (or her) choice from a specified list of areas.  All the students with choice in a particular area are assigned to one or more faculty facilitators.  Faculty facilitators assign the activities and tasks necessary for the course to the students and decide the desired mode of skills training.  They may decide to make small groups of students of varying group sizes to carry out the assigned activities and tasks.  They also make the required facilities available to the students to enable them to carry out the assigned activities and tasks.  The timetable will earmark specific hours for the subject.  But the students are expected to use their spare time (including holidays and after-lecture hours on working days) to learn the required skills and use these skills to accomplish the assigned activities and tasks.  The students, however, have to meet the faculty supervisors on the specified hours every week to appraise them of their progress, clear their doubts, if any, and chart their future plan.  The Head of KIIT Student Activity Centre (KSAC) will coordinate offering of the course.  COURSE OUTCOMES At successfully completing the course, the student will be able to  CO 1  : Develop the needed technical skills in their chosen fields of interest, CO 2  : Develop higher levels of self-confidence and soft skills such as communication, writing,  discussion and debate, time-management, and leadership skills, CO 3 : Apply the learned skills to give shape to their passionate ideas, CO 4 : Develop Innovation and entrepreneurial mindset, CO 5 : Analyze and judge a problem situation for deploying the learnt knowledge and skills and develop problem solving strategies and CO 6 : Build new products and services using the learned knowledge and skills.

Principles in Designing the Curricula The overriding principles in designing the new curricula are that the curricula must (1) Impart specialized and interdisciplinary knowledge and creative problem-solving skills; (2) Reflect aspirations of the society to turn out technology-ready and socially conscious graduates to anticipate and avoid future problems; (3) Leverage the strengths and help making up the weaknesses of the university; (4) Inform the students about new technologies and the emerging social, environmental, and global forces, and (5) Give students the confidence to work in teams and in multi-cultural settings.  Key Graduate Attributes Engineers are agents of social change.  They interact with the common man to know and define the current and the looming future problems, develop sustainable design solutions using their science and engineering skills, and implement sustainable solutions.  Thus, the graduating students must (1) Acquire knowledge and skills\u2014both technical and soft skills such as communication, leadership, and skills of working in multi-cultural, interdisciplinary teams; (2) Develop the mental disposition to understand, conceptualize, and define complex, real-world problems; (3) Be independent, critical thinkers to inquire into the root causes of the problems; (4) Analyse the relevant data and social, economic, and political forces influencing these problems; (5) Synthesize knowledge and diverse perspectives and approaches to find technically and financially viable, sustainable, creative, ethical solutions by evaluating novel alternatives; (6) Use project planning and scheduling methods, establish institutional mechanisms, and communicate the plans and schedules and inspire the concerned individuals to implement the solutions; (7) Imbibe professional values and ethics, and (8) Be life-long learners with empathy for others.  Strategies for Curriculum Design Strategies to design the curricula include (1) Understanding the dominant technological and social changes in the world, (2) Incorporating recommendations of the National Education Policy 2020 with respect to design of curricula, (3) Adding the novel features and best curricular practices of leading universities and institutes in India and abroad, (4) Recognizing the UGC and AICTE guidelines and ABET recommendations; (5) Using the opportunities that KIIT offers for multi- and inter-disciplinary education, and (6) Delivering the key attributes and skills which the graduating students should be equipped with.   The Structure of the Curricula The undergraduate engineering curricula are designed to inculcate in the students the graduate attributes indicated above.  The curricula include (1) foundational subjects in the fields of humanities, social sciences, science, engineering science, and vocational courses, (2) depth subjects\u2014both core and electives related to the respective disciplines, (3) open electives in diverse fields of humanities, arts, science, engineering, social science, management, law, public policy, media studies, etc., and (4) practice-based subjects.  These subjects reflect a mix of theory, hands-on laboratory practice, short- and long-duration projects, field visits, internship, and extra- and co-curricular activities.  The Institute has created many avenues for students to organize, lead, and actively participate in social, cultural, and techno-management functions to develop behavioural skills.        4  UG Programmes Offered by the Schools of Technology The B. Tech. (Hons.) and B. Tech. (Res.) programmes offered by various Schools of Technology are tabulated below. Name of the School B. Tech. (Hons.) and B. Tech. (Res.)

The students can choose subjects from a large number science, HASS, and engineering electives.  They can also choose subjects from lists of professional electives and open electives.  The professional electives allow the students to concentrate in selected areas, whereas the open electives allow the students to gain multidisciplinary knowledge 6. To ensure all-round development of students, the curricula have included subjects like Yoga, Universal Human Values, a Community/Environment-based Project, a Vocational Elective, Industry 4.0 Technologies, and K-Explore that consider students\u2019 co- and extra-curricular activities for evaluation. 7. The curricula have included subjects like Scientific and Technical Writing and Research Methods and Ethics to instill research and research communication skills in the students. 8. The curricula have also provided for independent projects in the last three semesters to train the students in the art and science of identifying pressing problems and finding their sustainable solutions.  Notes and Guidelines Science Core  Science forms the foundation of engineering.  Subjects related to physical, chemical, biological, environmental, and mathematical sciences are covered in the first four semesters in the form core and elective subjects.  The core subjects in science are the following:   Semester I/II: Physics, Chemistry, Science of Living Systems, Environmental Science, Differential Equations and Linear Algebra, Transform Calculus and Numerical Analysis, Physics Lab, and Chemistry Lab. Semester III: Probability & Statistics Semester IV: Selected Topics in Mathematics (Syllabi to be different for different Programmes)      5  Engineering Science Core  Engineering science subjects provide a bridge between science and engineering.  The related subjects are included as both core and electives.  The semester-wise distribution of the core engineering science subjects is given below. Semester I/II: Basic Electronics, Programming Lab, Engineering Drawing & Graphics, Workshop Practice, and Engineering Lab Half the number of experiments in Engineering Lab will relate to Basic Electronics and the other half will relate to Basic Electrical Engineering. Semester III: Industry 4.0 Technologies  HASS Core The curricula include HASS subjects as both core and electives.  The HASS subjects that improve the written and rhetoric skills, life skills and research skills of students are included as core subjects.    Semester-wise distribution of these subjects are given below: The semester-wise distribution of language- and human values-related subjects is given below: Semester I/II: English (to develop language skills and skills for making critical analysis of English literature) Semester I/II: Communication Lab (to develop skills of Listening, Speaking, and Writing) Semester I/II: Yoga (to bring about unity of mind and body) Semester III: Scientific and Technical Writing (to develop skills of writing varieties of scientific and technical documents) Semester VI: Universal Human Values (to develop and respect human values) and Engineering Professional Practice (to understand roles and responsibilities of engineers and the ethical and selected legal issues) Semester VIII: Research Methods and Ethics (for B. Tech. (Res.) students)  Professional Core Professional core subjects form the backbone of an engineering discipline.  Every School of Technology decides the list of core subjects that its students must credit.  These can be theory and laboratory subjects.  These subjects are diffused in Semester III through Semester VI.   Engineering Professional Practice, a professional core subject, is included as a HASS Elective but will be taught by engineering faculty.  Research Core  Students pursuing B. Tech. (Res.) programme have to go through a course on Research Methods and Ethics, which is offered in Semester VII.  Science, Engineering Science, and HASS Electives Options are available to the students to choose subjects from lists of science, engineering science, and HASS electives.  Their distributions in the curricula are as under: Semester I/II: Science Elective, Engineering Elective, and HASS Elective I. Semester IV: HASS Elective II Semester V: HASS Elective III Semester VI: HASS Elective IV  HASS Elective I includes Community/Environment-based project as one of the subjects. Done as a group work, the subject gives the students an opportunity to connect with the community and the environment, learn and prioritize their problems, and define them in ways that make them amenable to scientific analysis and pragmatic solution.   6  The lists of Science, Engineering Science, and HASS electives will be available in the ERP.  Before a semester begins the Institute will announce the subjects that will be offered in that semester and the students will have to give their choice of electives out of the offered subjects.  Vocational Elective Vocational Elective courses provide engineering students a deeper appreciation of the practical aspects of engineering and allow them to relate their theoretical knowledge with practical skills.  This subject is included in Semester III. A student must opt for one of the vocational electives which will be announced at the beginning of the semester.  Open Electives Open electives allow students to choose subjects from lists of subjects offered by all the Schools.  It is through these subjects that a student can pursue his or her latent interests in specific areas and work towards earning a Minor in an area which is outside his (or her) major engineering branch (if the subjects are selected in specific designated areas).  These subjects are offered in Semester V through Semester VIII:  Semester V:  K-Explore\u2014Practice-based Open Elective I  Semester VI \u2013 VIII:  Open Electives II, III, and IV  K-Explore is a 1-Credit Practice-based Open Elective that allows the students to use the scope that the Clubs and the Societies of KIIT University provides to learn the skills of Dance, Music, Photography, etc. and of conducting seminars and conferences through training, practice, and direct involvement.  Minor The curricula allow a student to earn a Minor in an area outside the core discipline in which he (or she) has registered. For example, a student doing B. Tech in Mechanical Engineering (his/her parent branch) can choose to have a Minor in Computer Science Engineering.  To get a Minor, a student must   (i) Get the fourth semester CGPA of 7.0 or more, (ii) Successfully fulfill the coursework requirement for at least six theory subjects and two credit Lab/project subjects in an area or discipline other than the one for which he (or she) is registered, and (iii) Complete at least 20 Credits of coursework in that area.  Thus, if a student has taken three Open Electives in one area other than his (or her) own then he (or she) must choose three more theory subjects and two Lab (or a 2 credit project) subjects in that area in the Fourth year. If no Lab subject is available in that Minor, then the student must choose an additional theory subject with at least 2 Credits. Students having no backlogs till the end of Semester 4 and a minimum CGPA of 7.0 will only be allowed to opt for the Minor scheme. Students opting for Minor have to mandatorily attend a minimum of 75% Theory and Lab classes (as the case may be) failing which the Minor option will be withdrawn.  Professional Electives Professional elective subjects provide the students the opportunity to concentrate in certain specific areas of their interest.  These subjects are offered in Semester V through Semester VIII for B. Tech. (Hons.) students (total 15 credits) and in Semester V through Semester VI for B. Tech. (Res.) students (total 9 credits).  The distribution of these subjects is given below: Semester V: Professional Electives (6 Credit),  Semester VI: Professional Electives (3 Credit),  Semester VII: Professional Elective (3 Credits) for only B. Tech (Hons.) students Semester VIII: Professional Elective (3 Credits) for only B. Tech (Hons.) students   7  esearch Electives The students pursuing B. Tech. (Res.) degree may need specialized knowledge in the areas of their theses.  For this reason, the curriculum provides for two research electives to be selected in Semester VII and Semester VIII.  Every School prepares a list of Research Electives and announces, at the beginning of every semester, the subject which will be offered in that semester.  The student is required to select the electives from out of these offered lists.  Summer Internship Internship exposes the students to the realities of engineering systems.  Every student must go through at least 60 days of internship. It can be taken in an industrial organization or at an institute of higher learning in the summer breaks after the second year and/or after the third year.  Internship carries 2 Credits.  And the grade secured by a student appears in the Semester VII Grade Sheet of the student.  Projects Projects allow the students to work under the supervision of a faculty advisor and apply their acquired knowledge to solve the real-world problems. They define problems, mine information from past works, conceptualize forces and factors that impact the problems, develop design solutions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the solutions.  Semester-wise distribution of this subject is given below:  Semester VI: Miner Project (2 Credits)  Semester VII: Project I (5 Credits)  Semester VIII: Project II (9 Credits for B. Tech. (Hons.) and 12 Credits for B. Tech. (Res.))  Semester-away Provision for Project II The Institute sometimes allows a student to carry out the fourth-year project (Project II) away from the University campus if the following conditions are satisfied: \u2022 This provision applies to Project II.   \u2022 That means a student can avail of this provision in Semester VIII. \u2022 The project must be done either in an industrial unit or in an academic institution. \u2022 The organization in which the student wishes to carry out the project must give in writing that it will provide all facilities (office space, equipment, instrument, data, and travel and stay facilities, if possible) for the student to do the project.

We start off with the concept of an energy band representation for the electrons and holes in semiconductors and relate the energy of the free electrons to the electrical and optical properties. The behavior of p-n junctions and other barrier potentials in semiconductor structures are analyzed. These junctions are presented as simple instruments that enable electrical injection of electrons with excess potential energy for radiative emission of photons. In reverse, these same junctions cause photo-generated electrons to drift rapidly across the field to generate a photocurrent. Semiconductor optoelectronic devices such as the LED, the laser diode, the photodetector are presented as mere converters of electrical energy to photon energy and vice-versa. Optical modulators are devices for controlling the intensity or phase of an optical beam using an electrical input. The course contains a good mix of the electrical properties and optical properties of semiconductors and the interplay between photons and the free electrons within.

Tech. curriculum provides for a 1-Credit practice-oriented Open Elective K-Xplore in Semester V to make our undergraduate engineering programme holistic, multidisciplinary, skill-based, and balanced.  This course allows the students to explore the opportunity that the KIIT University offers to them to sharpen their skills in areas which excite them the most.  Offered in a self-learning mode, this  subject allows the students to hone their skills in areas they are passionate about which they select from a wide spectrum of subjects in art, literature, technology, community engagement and service, health, and environment and sustainability. In addition, the students develop soft skills that are important for them in their professional life. This course, thus, allows students to explore and grow in areas outside of core academics and provides a channel for complementing the lessons learned in the classroom, offering them the opportunity to apply academic skills in a real-world context and providing a truly well-rounded education.  This course is designed on the basis of the guiding philosophy of student-centered learning where the students define problems, evaluate alternatives, design solutions, and self-learn by performing certain assigned activities with limited guidance from faculty facilitators.   Each student selects an area of his (or her) choice from a specified list of areas.  All the students with choice in a particular area are assigned to one or more faculty facilitators.  Faculty facilitators assign the activities and tasks necessary for the course to the students and decide the desired mode of skills training.  They may decide to 275  make small groups of students of varying group sizes to carry out the assigned activities and tasks.  They also make the required facilities available to the students to enable them to carry out the assigned activities and tasks.  The timetable will earmark specific hours for the subject.  But the students are expected to use their spare time (including holidays and after-lecture hours on working days) to learn the required skills and use these skills to accomplish the assigned activities and tasks.

Some electives may have seat limitations \nand will be offered in first cum first serve basis. In order to accommodate more aspiring students, electives \nhaving high demand may be offered twice, that is during autumn as elective-I or II and again as elective-III \nduring spring semester.  \n \nStudents can select electives based on their interest in a domain. Areas of specialization or domain are optional, \nhowever electives can be grouped to provide learning around a functional area. Students may qualify for a \nmaximum of one area of Specialization. Completion of the specialization will not be reflecting on transcripts or \ndegree certificate.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTHIRD SEMESTER \nTheory \nSl No. \nCourse Code \nSubjects \nL \nT \nP \nTotal \nCredit \n1 \nEV21001 \nAnalog and Digital Electronic Circuit \n3 \n1 \n0 \n4 \n4 \n2 \nEC20001 \nSignals and Systems \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n3 \nEV20001 \nMicrofabrication \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n4 \nCS20001 \nConcepts of Data Structures and Algorithms \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n5 \nMA21001 \nProbability and Statistics \n3 \n1 \n0 \n4 \n4 \n6 \nEX20003 \nScientific and Technical writing \n2 \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \nTotal Credit (Theory subjects) \n19 \n19 \nPractical \n1 \nEC29001 \nElectronic Circuits Lab \n0 \n0 \n4 \n4 \n2 \n2 \nCS29001 \nData Structures Lab \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n1 \nSessional \n1 \n \nVocational Elective \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n1 \nTotal Credit (Practical & Sessional subject) \n8 \n4 \nTotal Credit (Semester) \n27 \n23 \n \nFOURTH SEMESTER \nTheory \nSl No. \nCourse \nCode \nSubjects \nL \nT \nP \nTotal \nCredit \n1 \nMA21006 \nVectors, Differential Equations and Complex \nAnalysis \n3 \n1 \n0 \n4 \n4 \n2 \nEV20002 \nDigital VLSI Circuits \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n3 \nEV20004 \nDigital Logic Design with Verilog \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n4 \nEV20006 \nEmbedded Design and Computer Architecture  \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n5 \nEX20001 \nIndustry 4.0 Technologies  \n2 \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n6 \n \nHASS Elective-II \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \nTotal Credit (Theory subjects) \n18 \n18 \nPractical \n1 \nEV29002 \nDigital VLSI Lab \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n1 \n2 \nEV29004 \nVerilog Lab   \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n1 \n3 \nEV29006 \nEmbedded Lab \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n1 \nSessional \n1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal Credit (Practical & Sessional subject) \n6 \n3 \nTotal Credit (Semester) \n24 \n21 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIFTH SEMESTER \nTheory \nSl No. \nCourse \nCode \nSubjects \nL \nT \nP \nTotal \nCredit \n1 \nEC20008 \nCommunication Engineering \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n2 \nEV30001 \nMixed Signal IC Design \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n \nProfessional Elective-I \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n4 \n \nProfessional Elective-II \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n5 \n \nHASS Elective-III \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n6 \nHS30101 \nEngineering Economics \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \nTotal Credit (Theory subjects) \n18 \n18 \nPractical \n1 \nEV39001 \nAnalog IC Design Lab \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n1 \n2 \nEV39003 \nScripting Language and Python Lab \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n1 \nSessional \n1 \n \nK-Explore Open Elective-I \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n1 \n2 \nEC38001 \nElectronics Product Development \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n1 \nTotal Credit (Practical & Sessional subject) \n8 \n4 \nTotal Credit (Semester) \n26 \n22 \n \n \nSIXTH SEMESTER \nTheory \nSl No. \nCourse \nCode \nSubjects \nL \nT \nP \nTotal \nCredit \n1 \nEV30002 \nVLSI for Signal Processing \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n2 \nEV30004 \n SoC Design \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n3 \nEV30006 \nVLSI Verification and Testing \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n4 \nHS30401 \nUniversal Human Values \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n5 \n \nProfessional Elective-III \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n6 \n \nOpen Elective-II \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \nTotal Credit (Theory subjects) \n18 \n18 \nPractical \n1 \nEV39002 \nSoC Design Lab \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n1 \n2 \nEV39004 \nVLSI Testing and Verification Lab \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n1 \n \nEV39006 \nVLSI Signal Processing Lab \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n1 \nSessional \n1 \n \nMinor Project \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n2 \nTotal Credit (Practical & Sessional subject) \n8 \n5 \nTotal Credit (Semester) \n26 \n23 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSEVENTH SEMESTER \n \nTheory \nSl No. \nCourse \nCode \nSubjects \nL \nT \nP \nTotal \nCredit \n1 \nEX40003 \nEngineering Professional Practice \n2 \n0 \n0 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n \nProfessional Elective-IV \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n \nOpen Elective-III \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal Credit (Theory subjects) \n \n8 \nPractical \n1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSessional \n1 \nEV47001 \nProject-I \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n \nInternship/Training \n \n \n \n \n2 \nTotal Credit (Practical & Sessional subject) \n \n7 \nTotal Credit (Semester) \n \n15 \n \n \nEIGHTH SEMESTER \nTheory \nSl No. \nCourse \nCode \nSubjects \nL \nT \nP \nTotal \nCredit \n1 \n \nProfessional Elective-V \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n2 \n \nOpen Elective-IV \n3 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal Credit (Theory subjects) \n \n6 \nPractical \n1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSessional \n1 \nEV47002 \nProject-II \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal Credit (Practical & Sessional subject) \n \n9 \nTotal Credit (Semester) \n \n15 \n \n \n \n \n \nPROFESSIONAL ELECTIVES \u2013 I/II/III \nSl.

The course includes analog-time, discrete-time signals and, systems. The syllabus revisits \nthe continuous time transform methods like Fourier and Laplace. This will be followed by discrete time transform methods \nlike the Z transform, DFT, and its properties and system theoretic implications. Later, the concepts and foundations of \ndigital filter design and its realization are built up for FIR and IIR filters. \n \nCOURSE OUTCOMES \nAfter successfully completing the course, the students will be able to \n \nCO 1: Analyze continuous and discrete signals, apply sampling process, determine related characteristics. \nCO 2: Distinguish and classify various types of systems and analyze system characteristics in time domain. \nCO 3: Apply appropriate continuous time transformation technique for signal analysis. \nCO 4: Analyze the signal and its properties in its frequency domain using discrete time transformation techniques. \nCO 5: Apply Fourier transform techniques in real time applications.  \nCO 6: Apply the knowledge of analog filters to digital filters, design and realization of digital filter. \n \nCOURSE DETAILS  \n \n \nIntroduction to Signals and System \nRepresentation of continuous and discrete time signals, Basic operations, Sampling Theorem, Linear convolution, \nCorrelation. \n \nRevision of Fourier and Laplace Analysis \nSignificance of Fourier series in LTI system, Continuous time Fourier series formula.

Tech. curriculum provides for a 1-Credit practice-oriented Open Elective K-Xplore in Semester V to \nmake our undergraduate engineering programme holistic, multidisciplinary, skill-based, and balanced.  This \ncourse allows the students to explore the opportunity that the KIIT University offers to them to sharpen their \nskills in areas which excite them the most. \n \nOffered in a self-learning mode, this  subject allows the students to hone their skills in areas they are passionate \nabout which they select from a wide spectrum of subjects in art, literature, technology, community engagement \nand service, health, and environment and sustainability. In addition, the students develop soft skills that are \nimportant for them in their professional life. This course, thus, allows students to explore and grow in areas \noutside of core academics and provides a channel for complementing the lessons learned in the classroom, \noffering them the opportunity to apply academic skills in a real-world context and providing a truly well-\nrounded education. \n \nThis course is designed on the basis of the guiding philosophy of student-centered learning where the students \ndefine problems, evaluate alternatives, design solutions, and self-learn by performing certain assigned activities \nwith limited guidance from faculty facilitators. \n  \nEach student selects an area of his (or her) choice from a specified list of areas.  All the students with choice in a \nparticular area are assigned to one or more faculty facilitators.  Faculty facilitators assign the activities and tasks \nnecessary for the course to the students and decide the desired mode of skills training.  They may decide to \nmake small groups of students of varying group sizes to carry out the assigned activities and tasks.  They also \nmake the required facilities available to the students to enable them to carry out the assigned activities and tasks. \n \nThe timetable will earmark specific hours for the subject.  But the students are expected to use their spare time \n(including holidays and after-lecture hours on working days) to learn the required skills and use these skills to \naccomplish the assigned activities and tasks.  The students, however, have to meet the faculty supervisors on the \nspecified hours every week to appraise them of their progress, clear their doubts, if any, and chart their future \nplan. \n \nThe Head of KIIT Student Activity Centre (KSAC) will coordinate offering of the course. \n \nCOURSE OUTCOMES \nAt successfully completing the course, the student will be able to \n \nCO 1  : Develop the needed technical skills in their chosen fields of interest, \nCO 2  : Develop higher levels of self-confidence and soft skills such as communication, writing, \n \ndiscussion and debate,

They interact with the common man to know and define the current and \nthe looming future problems, develop sustainable design solutions using their science and engineering skills, \nand implement sustainable solutions.  Thus, the graduating students must (1) Acquire knowledge and skills\u2014\nboth technical and soft skills such as communication, leadership, and skills of working in multi-cultural, \ninterdisciplinary teams; (2) Develop the mental disposition to understand, conceptualize, and define complex, \nreal-world problems; (3) Be independent, critical thinkers to inquire into the root causes of the problems; (4) \nAnalyse the relevant data and social, economic, and political forces influencing these problems; (5) Synthesize \nknowledge and diverse perspectives and approaches to find technically and financially viable, sustainable, \ncreative, ethical solutions by evaluating novel alternatives; (6) Use project planning and scheduling methods, \nestablish institutional mechanisms, and communicate the plans and schedules and inspire the concerned \nindividuals to implement the solutions; (7) Imbibe professional values and ethics, and (8) Be life-long learners \nwith empathy for others. \n \nStrategies for Curriculum Design \nStrategies to design the curricula include (1) Understanding the dominant technological and social changes in \nthe world, (2) Incorporating recommendations of the National Education Policy 2020 with respect to design of \ncurricula, (3) Adding the novel features and best curricular practices of leading universities and institutes in \nIndia and abroad, (4) Recognizing the UGC and AICTE guidelines and ABET recommendations; (5) Using the \nopportunities that KIIT offers for multi- and inter-disciplinary education, and (6) Delivering the key attributes \nand skills which the graduating students should be equipped with.  \n \nThe Structure of the Curricula \nThe undergraduate engineering curricula are designed to inculcate in the students the graduate attributes \nindicated above.  The curricula include (1) foundational subjects in the fields of humanities, social sciences, \nscience, engineering science, and vocational courses, (2) depth subjects\u2014both core and electives related to the \nrespective disciplines, (3) open electives in diverse fields of humanities, arts, science, engineering, social \nscience, management, law, public policy, media studies, etc., and (4) practice-based subjects.  These subjects \nreflect a mix of theory, hands-on laboratory practice, short- and long-duration projects, field visits, internship, \nand extra- and co-curricular activities.  The Institute has created many avenues for students to organize, lead, \nand actively participate in social, cultural, and techno-management functions to develop behavioural skills.   \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nUG Programmes Offered by the Schools of Technology \nThe B. Tech. (Hons.) and B. Tech. (Res.) programmes offered by various Schools of Technology are tabulated \nbelow. \nName of the School \nB. Tech. (Hons.) and B. Tech. (Res.)

The curricula allow the students to opt for either a B. Tech. (Hon.) degree or a B. Tech. (Res.) degree. \n2. All the B. Tech. curricula have total of 160 \u2013 165 credits. \n3. The curricula provide option for a Minor in selected areas if students fulfill additional credit \nrequirements. \n4. With the inclusion of many Humanities, Arts, and Social Science (HASS) subjects, the curricula are \nHASS-rich.   \n5. The curricula provide flexibility in many forms.  The students can choose subjects from a large number \nscience, HASS, and engineering electives.  They can also choose subjects from lists of professional \nelectives and open electives.  The professional electives allow the students to concentrate in selected \nareas, whereas the open electives allow the students to gain multidisciplinary knowledge \n6. To ensure all-round development of students, the curricula have included subjects like Yoga, Universal \nHuman Values, a Community/Environment-based Project, a Vocational Elective, Industry 4.0 \nTechnologies, and K-Explore that consider students\u2019 co- and extra-curricular activities for evaluation. \n7. The curricula have included subjects like Scientific and Technical Writing and Research Methods and \nEthics to instill research and research communication skills in the students. \n8. The curricula have also provided for independent projects in the last three semesters to train the students \nin the art and science of identifying pressing problems and finding their sustainable solutions. \n \nNotes and Guidelines \nScience Core  \nScience forms the foundation of engineering.  Subjects related to physical, chemical, biological, environmental, \nand mathematical sciences are covered in the first four semesters in the form core and elective subjects.  The \ncore subjects in science are the following:   \nSemester I/II: \nPhysics, Chemistry, Science of Living Systems, Environmental Science, Differential \nEquations and Linear Algebra, Transform Calculus and Numerical Analysis, Physics \nLab, and Chemistry Lab. \nSemester III: Probability & Statistics \nSemester IV: Selected Topics in Mathematics (Syllabi to be different for different Programmes) \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nEngineering Science Core  \nEngineering science subjects provide a bridge between science and engineering.  The related subjects are \nincluded as both core and electives.  The semester-wise distribution of the core engineering science subjects is \ngiven below. \nSemester I/II: \nBasic Electronics, Programming Lab, Engineering Drawing & Graphics, Workshop \nPractice, and Engineering Lab \nHalf the number of experiments in Engineering Lab will relate to Basic Electronics and \nthe other half will relate to Basic Electrical Engineering. \nSemester III: Industry 4.0 Technologies \n \nHASS Core \nThe curricula include HASS subjects as both core and electives.  The HASS subjects that improve the written \nand rhetoric skills, life skills and research skills of students are included as core subjects.    Semester-wise \ndistribution of these subjects are given below: \nThe semester-wise distribution of language- and human values-related subjects is given below: \nSemester I/II: English (to develop language skills and skills for making critical analysis of English \nliterature) \nSemester I/II: Communication Lab (to develop skills of Listening, Speaking, and Writing) \nSemester I/II: Yoga (to bring about unity of mind and body) \nSemester III: Scientific and Technical Writing (to develop skills of writing varieties of scientific and \ntechnical documents) \nSemester VI: Universal Human Values (to develop and respect human values) and Engineering \nProfessional Practice (to understand roles and responsibilities of engineers and the \nethical and selected legal issues) \nSemester VIII: Research Methods and Ethics (for B. Tech. (Res.) students) \n \nProfessional Core \nProfessional core subjects form the backbone of an engineering discipline.  Every School of Technology decides \nthe list of core subjects that its students must credit.  These can be theory and laboratory subjects.  These \nsubjects are diffused in Semester III through Semester VI.   \nEngineering Professional Practice, a professional core subject, is included as a HASS Elective but will be taught \nby engineering faculty. \n \nResearch Core  \nStudents pursuing B. Tech. (Res.) programme have to go through a course on Research Methods and Ethics, \nwhich is offered in Semester VII. \n \nScience, Engineering Science, and HASS Electives \nOptions are available to the students to choose subjects from lists of science, engineering science, and HASS \nelectives.  Their distributions in the curricula are as under: \nSemester I/II: \nScience Elective, Engineering Elective, and HASS Elective I. \nSemester IV: \nHASS Elective II \nSemester V: \nHASS Elective III \nSemester VI: \nHASS Elective IV \n \nHASS Elective I includes Community/Environment-based project as one of the subjects. Done as a group work, \nthe subject gives the students an opportunity to connect with the community and the environment, learn and \nprioritize their problems, and define them in ways that make them amenable to scientific analysis and pragmatic \nsolution.  \n \n6 \n \nThe lists of Science, Engineering Science, and HASS electives will be available in the ERP.  Before a semester \nbegins the Institute will announce the subjects that will be offered in that semester and the students will have to \ngive their choice of electives out of the offered subjects. \n \nVocational Elective \nVocational Elective courses provide engineering students a deeper appreciation of the practical aspects of \nengineering and allow them to relate their theoretical knowledge with practical skills.  This subject is included \nin Semester III. A student must opt for one of the vocational electives which will be announced at the beginning \nof the semester. \n \nOpen Electives \nOpen electives allow students to choose subjects from lists of subjects offered by all the Schools.  It is through \nthese subjects that a student can pursue his or her latent interests in specific areas and work towards earning a \nMinor in an area which is outside his (or her) major engineering branch (if the subjects are selected in specific \ndesignated areas).  These subjects are offered in Semester V through Semester VIII: \n \nSemester V:  \nK-Explore\u2014Practice-based Open Elective I \n \nSemester VI \u2013 VIII:  Open Electives II, III, and IV \n \nK-Explore is a 1-Credit Practice-based Open Elective that allows the students to use the scope that the Clubs \nand the Societies of KIIT University provides to learn the skills of Dance, Music, Photography, etc. and of \nconducting seminars and conferences through training, practice, and direct involvement. \n \nMinor \nThe curricula allow a student to earn a Minor in an area outside the core discipline in which he (or she) has \nregistered. For example, a student doing B. Tech in Mechanical Engineering (his/her parent branch) can choose \nto have a Minor in Computer Science Engineering.  To get a Minor, a student must  \n \n(i) \nGet the fourth semester CGPA of 7.0 or more, \n(ii) \nSuccessfully fulfill the coursework requirement for at least six theory subjects and two credit \nLab/project subjects in an area or discipline other than the one for which he (or she) is \nregistered, and \n(iii) \nComplete at least 20 Credits of coursework in that area. \n \nThus, if a student has taken three Open Electives in one area other than his (or her) own then he (or she) must \nchoose three more theory subjects and two Lab (or a 2 credit project) subjects in that area in the Fourth year. \nIf no Lab subject is available in that Minor, then the student must choose an additional theory subject with at \nleast 2 Credits. Students having no backlogs till the end of Semester 4 and a minimum CGPA of 7.0 will only be \nallowed to opt for the Minor scheme. Students opting for Minor have to mandatorily attend a minimum of 75% \nTheory and Lab classes (as the case may be) failing which the Minor option will be withdrawn. \n \nProfessional Electives \nProfessional elective subjects provide the students the opportunity to concentrate in certain specific areas of \ntheir interest.  These subjects are offered in Semester V through Semester VIII for B. Tech. (Hons.) students \n(total 15 credits) and in Semester V through Semester VI for B. Tech. (Res.) students (total 9 credits).  The \ndistribution of these subjects is given below: \nSemester V: \nProfessional Electives (6 Credit),  \nSemester VI: \nProfessional Electives (3 Credit),  \nSemester VII: Professional Elective (3 Credits) for only B. Tech (Hons.) students \nSemester VIII: Professional Elective (3 Credits) for only B. Tech (Hons.) students \n \n \n7 \n \nesearch Electives \nThe students pursuing B. Tech. (Res.) degree may need specialized knowledge in the areas of their theses.  For \nthis reason, the curriculum provides for two research electives to be selected in Semester VII and Semester VIII.  \nEvery School prepares a list of Research Electives and announces, at the beginning of every semester, the \nsubject which will be offered in that semester.  The student is required to select the electives from out of these \noffered lists. \n \nSummer Internship \nInternship exposes the students to the realities of engineering systems.  Every student must go through at least \n60 days of internship. It can be taken in an industrial organization or at an institute of higher learning in the \nsummer breaks after the second year and/or after the third year.  Internship carries 2 Credits.  And the grade \nsecured by a student appears in the Semester VII Grade Sheet of the student. \n \nProjects \nProjects allow the students to work under the supervision of a faculty advisor and apply their acquired \nknowledge to solve the real-world problems. They define problems, mine information from past works, \nconceptualize forces and factors that impact the problems, develop design solutions, and demonstrate the \neffectiveness of the solutions.  Semester-wise distribution of this subject is given below: \n \nSemester VI: \nMiner Project (2 Credits) \n \nSemester VII: Project I (5 Credits) \n \nSemester VIII: Project II (9 Credits for B. Tech. (Hons.) and 12 Credits for B. Tech. (Res.)) \n \nSemester-away Provision for Project II \nThe Institute sometimes allows a student to carry out the fourth-year project (Project II) away from the \nUniversity campus if the following conditions are satisfied: \n\u2022 \nThis provision applies to Project II.   \n\u2022 \nThat means a student can avail of this provision in Semester VIII. \n\u2022 \nThe project must be done either in an industrial unit or in an academic institution. \n\u2022 \nThe organization in which the student wishes to carry out the project must give in writing that it will \nprovide all facilities (office space, equipment, instrument, data, and travel and stay facilities, if possible) \nfor the student to do the project.  In addition, it will also identify a senior and competent employee of \nthe organization to whom the student will report.   \n\u2022 \nThe faculty supervisor must recommend the student\u2019s application for availing the semester-away \nprovision.  \n\u2022 \nA co-supervisor from the organization may be appointed for the project. \n\u2022 \nThe intending student gives an undertaking that he (or she) will  \n- \nRemain in constant touch with the faculty supervisor, \n- \nSend monthly progress reports to the supervisor, \n- \nGive seminar presentations, whenever required. \n- \nCollect class notes, read books, and prepare for and appear at the examinations (online, if \nnecessary).  The student must also do and submit all home assignments given by the teachers and \ngive seminar presentation (online) if necessary. \n\u2022 \nSince Semester VIII curricula have one theory subject (B. Tech. (Res.)) and two theory subjects (B. \nTech. (Hons.)) students, a student applying for this provision will be exempted from attending the \nlectures on these subjects.  But the student must give an undertaking that it will be his (or her) \nresponsibility to collect class notes, read books and other reading materials, submit all home \nassignments, give seminar presentations (online if required) and prepare for and appear at the \nexaminations.   \n \n \n8 \n \nSCHEME I \nFIRST SEMESTER \nTheory \nSl.

Tech. curriculum provides for a 1-Credit practice-oriented Open Elective K-Xplore in Semester V to \nmake our undergraduate engineering programme holistic, multidisciplinary, skill-based, and balanced.  This \ncourse allows the students to explore the opportunity that the KIIT University offers to them to sharpen their \nskills in areas which excite them the most. \n \nOffered in a self-learning mode, this  subject allows the students to hone their skills in areas they are passionate \nabout which they select from a wide spectrum of subjects in art, literature, technology, community engagement \nand service, health, and environment and sustainability. In addition, the students develop soft skills that are \nimportant for them in their professional life. This course, thus, allows students to explore and grow in areas \noutside of core academics and provides a channel for complementing the lessons learned in the classroom, \noffering them the opportunity to apply academic skills in a real-world context and providing a truly well-\nrounded education. \n \nThis course is designed on the basis of the guiding philosophy of student-centered learning where the students \ndefine problems, evaluate alternatives, design solutions, and self-learn by performing certain assigned activities \nwith limited guidance from faculty facilitators. \n  \nEach student selects an area of his (or her) choice from a specified list of areas.  All the students with choice in a \nparticular area are assigned to one or more faculty facilitators.  Faculty facilitators assign the activities and tasks \nnecessary for the course to the students and decide the desired mode of skills training.  They may decide to \n275 \n \nmake small groups of students of varying group sizes to carry out the assigned activities and tasks.  They also \nmake the required facilities available to the students to enable them to carry out the assigned activities and tasks. \n \nThe timetable will earmark specific hours for the subject.  But the students are expected to use their spare time \n(including holidays and after-lecture hours on working days) to learn the required skills and use these skills to \naccomplish the assigned activities and tasks.  The students, however, have to meet the faculty supervisors on the \nspecified hours every week to appraise them of their progress, clear their doubts, if any, and chart their future \nplan. \n \nThe Head of KIIT Student Activity Centre (KSAC) will coordinate offering of the course. \n \nCOURSE OUTCOMES \nAt successfully completing the course, the student will be able to \n \nCO 1  : Develop the needed technical skills in their chosen fields of interest, \nCO 2  : Develop higher levels of self-confidence and soft skills such as communication, writing,  discussion \nand debate, time-management, and leadership skills, \nCO 3 : \nApply the learned skills to give shape to their passionate ideas, \nCO 4 : \nDevelop Innovation and entrepreneurial mindset, \nCO 5 : \nAnalyze and judge a problem situation for deploying the learnt knowledge and skills and develop \nproblem solving strategies and \nCO 6 : \nBuild new products and services using the learned knowledge and skills.
